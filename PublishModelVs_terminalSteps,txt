Below is a precise walkthrough you can execute manually (no further code changes needed) to validate the full publish → request edit → approve → update flow and confirm the AUTHOR MGMT panel behavior.

Checklist

Reload VS Terminal (analyst session) and verify AUTHOR MGMT auto-load shows “(none)”.
Publish a model as analyst (ensure allowed_functions set).
Log out (or open separate browser) and log in as investor.
Visit /published, locate model, submit edit request.
Reload VS Terminal (analyst) → AUTHOR MGMT should list the pending request.
Approve request from panel.
Switch back to investor; fetch model details (or re-open /published), then call update endpoint to modify README or allowed_functions; confirm success.
(Optional) Re-run function to verify run_count increments.
Detailed Steps

Analyst side (Session A):

Navigate to /vs_terminal.
Enter or load code in the editor. Include at least one safe public function, for example: def add(a, b): return a + b
Click Publish. When prompted for name, use something distinctive, e.g. demo_pub1.
(If you need allowed functions) After initial publish, republish including publish UI logic (if your current publishModel() doesn’t send allowed_functions, you can later add them by update once you approve yourself or modify publish call—current JS sends only name/code; allowed list starts empty, so investor won’t be able to run until you republish with allowed_functions or update after publishing.) To ensure run works, you can manually publish again after editing publishModel() to send allowed_functions, or after approving investor, perform an update with allowed_functions.


Investor side (Session B): 
5. Log in as investor; go to /published. 6. Find demo_pub1 (search if needed). Click Request (permission dialog) and submit a reason like “Need to enhance function.” 7. (Optional) If allowed_functions was empty, you can still request edit; run may be limited until functions added.

Analyst approval: 8. Return to Session A (/vs_terminal). Wait 1–2 seconds (panel auto loads) or click Refresh in AUTHOR MGMT panel. 9. Pending request should appear with Approve / Deny buttons. Click Approve. Panel refreshes; request disappears (if you want to confirm, refresh again—should now show (none)).

Investor update: 10. In investor session, fetch model details: GET /api/published_models/<model_id> (You can capture id by viewing network in /published or using the request output in browser console: the catalog fetch returns an array with id.) 11. Update README or allowed functions: POST /api/published_models/<model_id>/update JSON body example (to enable running add): { "readme_md": "Updated README by investor after approval", "allowed_functions": ["add"] } Expect response: {"ok": true, "changed": {"readme_md": true, "allowed_functions": true}, ...}

Run test (investor): 12. Use Run button (either from /published run dialog or VS Terminal published details if you add an investor-facing UI) selecting add with args [2,3]. Should return 5 and increment run_count.

AUTHOR MGMT Panel Confirmation:

Before investor request: (none)
After request: shows one entry with pending.
After approval: entry disappears on refresh; investor can update.
Troubleshooting Tips

If request doesn’t appear: Ensure _user_key for analyst returns a value matching author_user_key created at publish time. Check /api/published_models response for author_user_key.
If approving returns unauthorized: Confirm you’re logged in as the same user who published (author).
If update from investor returns unauthorized: Confirm the edit request status became approved (panel refresh or GET /api/published_models/<id>/requests).
If run endpoint rejects function not allowed: Confirm allowed_functions array includes that function via update.
Optional Improvement (future):

Modify publishModel() JS to prompt for allowed functions and send them with initial publish (add allowed_functions array to body).
Show editor visibility and a quick button to add default allowed functions from introspection.
Let me know if you want me to patch the publishModel() call to include allowed functions or add an investor run convenience panel.
