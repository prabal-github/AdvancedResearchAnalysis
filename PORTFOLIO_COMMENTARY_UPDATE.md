# Portfolio Commentary System Update Documentation

## Overview

This document details the updates made to the `portfolio_commentary` table in the investment research database. The key enhancement was adding an `investor_id` field to enable investor-specific portfolio commentaries.

## Changes Made

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Added `investor_id` field to the `portfolio_commentary` table
   - Field type: TEXT (to accommodate various ID formats)
   - Field is nullable (to support both investor-specific and general commentaries)

2. **Migration Process**
   - Created a temporary table with the updated schema
   - Transferred existing data to preserve historical commentaries
   - Dropped the original table
   - Renamed the temporary table to the original name

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Migration script: `fix_commentary_table.py`
   - Database affected: `instance/investment_research.db`
   - Table affected: `portfolio_commentary`

4. **Testing**
   - Verified table structure with `list_tables.py`
   - Basic functionality test with `test_commentary.py`
   - Comprehensive test with `test_commentary_comprehensive.py`

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Commentary with Investor ID

```python
from app import db, PortfolioCommentary

# Create a new commentary for a specific investor
new_commentary = PortfolioCommentary(
    commentary_text="Portfolio analysis for investor XYZ",
    market_data=json.dumps({"market_index": "NIFTY", "change": 0.5}),
    analysis_metadata=json.dumps({"stocks_analyzed": 10}),
    improvements_made="Added sector analysis",
    investor_id="investor_xyz_123"  # Specify the investor ID
)

db.session.add(new_commentary)
db.session.commit()
```

### Querying Commentaries for a Specific Investor

```python
# Using SQLAlchemy
investor_commentaries = PortfolioCommentary.query.filter_by(investor_id="investor_xyz_123").all()

# Using raw SQL
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM portfolio_commentary WHERE investor_id = ?", ("investor_xyz_123",))
results = cursor.fetchall()
```

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Each investor can now have their own portfolio commentary
2. **Improved Organization**: Commentaries can be easily filtered by investor
3. **Enhanced Analytics**: Investor-specific analysis can be tracked over time
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing commentaries without investor_id remain functional

## Conclusion

The database migration has been successfully completed, adding investor-specific functionality to the portfolio commentary system. The system has been thoroughly tested and is ready for use in production.
