## 8. Next Technical Steps

1. Implement model registry abstraction (interfaces + metadata store)
2. Build agent dispatcher with async concurrency & caching
3. Ship 10 low-complexity models (drift, sentiment, volatility basic) for early validation
4. Introduce evaluation harness (backtest & live validation metrics)
5. Add provider router (Anthropic/Ollama) with health checks
6. Observability: instrument latency, fallback rates, accuracy drift
7. Gradual rollout with feature flags per tier
