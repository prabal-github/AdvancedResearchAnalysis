### Live Testing Results
```
🎯 NIFTY Options Put-Call Ratio Analyzer - TEST SUCCESS ✅

📊 Live Market Data:
- Current NIFTY Level: 25,000
- Max Pain Level: 25,000
- Put-Call Ratio (OI): 1.501 (High bearish sentiment)
- Put-Call Ratio (Volume): 0.830
- Total Call OI: 11,082,525
- Total Put OI: 16,631,925

🎯 Generated Signal:
- Action: 🟢 BUY (Contrarian bullish signal)
- Reasoning: Very high PCR OI indicates extreme bearish sentiment
- Confidence: 80.1%
- Target: 25,500
- Stop Loss: 24,625
```

## 🎪 SIGNAL GENERATION LOGIC

### Put-Call Ratio Analysis
```python
# Bullish Signals (Contrarian)
if pcr_oi > 1.3:  # Extreme bearish sentiment
    signal = "STRONG BUY"
    confidence = 80-90%

if pcr_oi > 1.1:  # High bearish sentiment  
    signal = "BUY"
    confidence = 70-80%

# Bearish Signals (Contrarian)
if pcr_oi < 0.7:  # Extreme bullish sentiment
    signal = "STRONG SELL"
    confidence = 80-90%

if pcr_oi < 0.9:  # High bullish sentiment
    signal = "SELL" 
    confidence = 70-80%
```

### Max Pain Analysis
```python
# Gravitational Pull Theory
pain_diff = (current_price - max_pain) / max_pain * 100

if pain_diff > 2%:    # Above Max Pain
    signal = "SELL" (gravitational pull down)
    
if pain_diff < -2%:   # Below Max Pain  
    signal = "BUY" (gravitational pull up)
```

### Volume Confirmation
```python
# Volume-based confirmation signals
if pcr_volume > 1.5:  # High put volume
    confirmation = "BULLISH" (bearish exhaustion)
    
if pcr_volume < 0.6:  # Low put volume
    confirmation = "BEARISH" (bullish exhaustion)
```
