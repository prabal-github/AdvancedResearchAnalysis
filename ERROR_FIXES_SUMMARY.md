## AI Research Assistant - Error Fixes Summary

### ✅ **Issues Successfully Resolved:**

1. **Report.recommendations Attribute Error** - FIXED ✓

   - **Problem**: Code was referencing `Report.recommendations` which doesn't exist in the model
   - **Solution**: Replaced with `Report.original_text` in search queries
   - **Impact**: Knowledge base search now works properly

2. **Deprecated datetime.utcnow() Warnings** - PARTIALLY FIXED ✓

   - **Problem**: Multiple deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()`
   - **Solution**:
     - Added `timezone` import to datetime
     - Created `utc_now()` helper function using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
     - Fixed key occurrences in AI analysis functions (lines 1150, 6840, 6904)
   - **Impact**: Removed most deprecation warnings

3. **Application Context Error** - PARTIALLY FIXED ⚠️
   - **Problem**: Alert checking running outside Flask application context
   - **Solution**: Wrapped alert checking function with `app.app_context()`
   - **Status**: Function structure needs refinement but context issue addressed

### 🔧 **Key Improvements Made:**

1. **Enhanced Ticker Extraction**:

   - Improved regex patterns for TCS.NS, INFY.BO formats
   - Better false positive filtering
   - Handles various Indian stock ticker formats

2. **Fixed Search Functions**:

   - `search_knowledge_base()` now uses correct Report model attributes
   - Enhanced ticker variation matching
   - Better error handling

3. **Timezone-Aware DateTime**:
   - Created `utc_now()` helper function
   - Updated critical timestamp operations
   - Reduced deprecation warnings
