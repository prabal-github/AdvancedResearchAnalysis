# Fundamental Analysis and Stock Quality Features

## Overview

The research quality application has been successfully enhanced with two new major features:

1. **Detailed Fundamental Analysis of Stocks** - Comprehensive analysis of stocks that analysts are picking
2. **Stock Quality Score Integration** - Quality scores of stocks integrated into the composite scoring system

## üÜï New Features Implemented

- Extracts data from yfinance including P/E ratios, ROE, debt-to-equity, growth rates, and more

#### Key Functions Added:
- `get_detailed_fundamental_analysis(ticker)` - Main analysis function
- `calculate_fundamental_metrics(hist_data)` - Technical metrics calculation
- `calculate_stock_quality_score(info, hist_data)` - Quality scoring algorithm
- `get_quality_rating(score)` - Convert numerical score to descriptive rating

#### API Endpoint:
