Portfolio Insurance Feature Breakdown

- Define insurance product scope (coverage: drawdown %, benchmark underperformance, volatility spike)
- Select eligible portfolios (AUM thresholds, asset classes, liquidity filters)
- Choose protection types (max drawdown cover, floor guarantee, tail-risk hedge, benchmark spread collar, volatility cap)
- Specify triggers (end-of-day NAV drop, rolling 30‑day drawdown, intraday circuit, benchmark underperformance > X bps)
- Determine measurement frequencies (real‑time shadow NAV, EOD batch, weekly checkpoints)
- Set coverage limits (notional cap, duration, deductible, waiting period)
- Pricing model (option replication, CPPI premium, historical VaR-based premium, Monte Carlo stress surcharge)
- Premium collection methods (upfront, periodic, performance-linked rebate)
- Capital reserve / reinsurance structure (internal buffer, external hedge, dynamic delta hedging)
- Risk metrics engine (drawdown calculator, VaR / ES, beta, correlation, tail loss estimator)
- Data feeds (market prices, corporate actions, FX, benchmark indices, volatility surfaces)
- Pricing and risk libraries (options greeks, scenario generation, stress shocks)
- Policy lifecycle states (quote, pending underwriting, active, suspended, claim filed, claim settled, expired)
- Underwriting rules (concentration limits, leverage checks, historical volatility thresholds)
- Quote workflow (upload/ingest positions, validate, simulate stress, premium quote, accept & bind)
- Position ingestion (API, file upload, prime broker feed, manual adjust)
- Continuous monitoring service (portfolio valuation, trigger checks, breach logging)
- Alerting (pre-breach warnings, breach detection, claim eligibility notification)
- Claim evaluation logic (verify trigger, recompute independent NAV path, apply deductible, calculate payout)
- Payout calculation formulas (covered_loss = max(0, insured_floor - current_value) * coverage_ratio)
- Payout execution (internal ledger credit, external payment, stablecoin transfer)
- Hedge execution module (dynamic option hedges, futures overlays, variance swap proxies)
- Premium & reserve accounting (deferred revenue schedule, reserve adequacy tests)
- Exposure aggregation (by client, strategy, asset class, counterparty)
- Risk limits dashboard (utilization vs limits, worst-case stress, aggregate insured notional)
- Audit trail (quotes, parameter changes, trigger evaluations, claim decisions)
- Compliance checks (KYC/AML, jurisdictional constraints, regulatory capital reporting)
- Governance (manual override controls, approval queue, exception logging)
- Scenario analysis tools (historical replay, forward Monte Carlo, fat-tail shocks)
- Versioned policy documents (legal terms, coverage schedule, exclusions)
- Client UI (coverage summary, remaining term, triggers, premium schedule, claim status)
- Internal admin UI (underwriting queue, risk heatmap, hedge positions, capital buffers)
- Notification channels (email, in-app, WhatsApp/Telegram, webhook)
- API endpoints (quote request, policy status, premium invoice, claim submission, payout status)
- Security & permissions (investor, manager, underwriter, risk officer, auditor roles)
- Rate limiter & abuse prevention (quote spam detection, anomaly scoring)
- Backtesting framework (historical portfolios vs hypothetical insurance outcomes)
- Stress test harness (systemic crash, volatility spike, liquidity freeze scenarios)
- Data retention & archival (position snapshots, NAV history, claims history)
- Logging & observability (metrics: active policies, insured notional, realized losses, hedge PnL)
- Periodic recalibration (premium factors, model parameter drift checks)
- Business continuity plan (fallback pricing mode, delayed data handling)
- Documentation (user guide, risk methodology, pricing whitepaper, API spec)
- Rollout plan (beta cohort, caps on insured notional, phased asset class expansion)
- SLA & support workflows (response times, escalation matrix, incident tracking)
