I’ll outline a simple, role-aware onboarding that fits your current stack (Flask + Jinja + Bootstrap + AOS/Toastr/Select2) and keeps it lightweight.

Checklist

Add role-aware “Getting Started” panels on dashboards.
Provide an interactive tour (“Show me around”).
Create dedicated Help pages (/help/investor, /help/analyst).
Sprinkle contextual tips (tooltips/popovers) across key controls.
Remember dismiss/remember states (localStorage) so tutorials don’t nag.
What to use
Bootstrap tooltips/popovers: quick, contextual hints on icons/buttons you already have.
Intro.js or Shepherd.js (pick one):
Intro.js: tiny, easy, no dependencies (good default).
Shepherd.js: more customizable (needs tippy.js/Popper).
Bootstrap Offcanvas/Modal: for a “Help Center” drawer or “Getting Started” modal.
Static pages: simple Jinja templates for /help/investor and /help/analyst.
LocalStorage: remember “dismissed” or “completed tour” per role.
Optional: short Loom/YT videos embedded in help pages.
How to add it (high-level)
Role-aware “Getting Started” card

On investor/analyst dashboards, show a dismissible card at the top with 3–5 key actions, e.g.:
Investor: “Review Risk Profile → Explore ML Models → Analyze New Report”
Analyst: “Update Profile → Submit Research → Check Certificate Status”
Include a “Show me around” button that starts the tour.
Interactive tour with Intro.js

Add data attributes on important elements (sidebar Dashboard, Analyze New, AI Assistant, ML Models).
Define a small JS init function per page that builds steps (title + description + element).
Store localStorage.setItem('tourDismissed_investor', '1') when finished or dismissed.
Add a “Start Tour” item in the profile dropdown to replay.
Help pages

Create /help/investor and /help/analyst with:
Short overview, step-by-step guides, screenshots, and an optional 60–90s Loom embed.
Link to these pages from the navbar dropdown and sidebar.
Keep content modular (sections: Navigation, Key Tasks, Tips, FAQs).
Contextual tips

Use Bootstrap tooltips for terse “?” icons near inputs and action buttons.
Use popovers for slightly longer explanations (e.g., “What is Risk Profiling?”).
Empty states

When lists are empty (no reports/portfolio items), show a friendly card with 1–2 steps and a CTA button.
Remembering state

Use localStorage to hide the “Getting Started” card after “Don’t show again.”
Track completion events (optional) with a lightweight endpoint if you want analytics.
Minimal structure to add
Templates

templates/help_investor.html (how-to, screenshots, short video)
templates/help_analyst.html (profile, research submission, certificates, analytics)
Small includes for the “Getting Started” card (e.g., _getting_started_investor.html, _getting_started_analyst.html)
Static JS

static/js/tour.js:
initInvestorTour(), initAnalystTour()
Reads data attributes on elements and runs Intro.js
Optional: static/css/help.css for minor formatting
Wiring

Navbar dropdown: add “Help & Tutorials” and “Start Tour” links.
Dashboards: include the role-specific “Getting Started” partial if not dismissed.
Content outline (quick)
Investor

Start here: Risk Profile, Investor Dashboard overview
ML Models: reading results and recommendations
Analyze New Report: where to submit and read summaries
Portfolio tools: stress test and alerts
Tips: plan limits, “previous data” banner meaning
Analyst

Profile setup and certificate request/status
Submitting research and best practices (headings, tickers, topics)
Performance/leaderboards, report hub
Admin-only tools (if applicable)
Optional extras
A Help off-canvas (Bootstrap) for quick tips without leaving the page.
A tiny search box on /help/* pages (client-side filter on headings).
A “First-login only” auto-tour trigger (then rely on the button later).
If you want, I can scaffold the two help pages, the getting-started card partials, and a tiny Intro.js tour initializer next.
