# Multi-Factor Expected Return Model
### Academic Factor-Based Expected Return Prediction for Strategic Portfolio Construction

---

## Executive Summary

The Multi-Factor Expected Return Model represents a sophisticated implementation of academic factor investing principles, combining five key factors that have demonstrated persistent risk premia in equity markets. This advanced model systematically evaluates stocks across value, quality, momentum, size, and low volatility dimensions to generate expected return forecasts and composite factor scores for strategic portfolio construction and factor-based investment strategies.

## System Overview

- **Academic Foundation**: Based on Fama-French factor models and established quantitative research
- **Expected Return Calculation**: Factor premium-based approach with risk-free rate anchoring
- **Cross-Sectional Ranking**: Relative scoring across the investment universe
- **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Sharpe ratios, volatility, and maximum drawdown integration

## Factor Framework & Methodology

### 1. Value Factor (25% Weight)
**Rationale**: Stocks with attractive valuations relative to fundamentals
**Metrics**:
- Price-to-Earnings ratio (inverse scoring)
- Price-to-Book ratio (inverse scoring)  
- Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio (inverse scoring)
**Calculation**: Lower valuation ratios receive higher scores, normalized around market benchmarks

### 2. Quality Factor (25% Weight)
**Rationale**: Companies with superior financial health and operational efficiency
**Metrics**:
- Return on Equity (ROE)
- Return on Assets (ROA)
- Debt-to-Equity ratio (inverse)
- Current Ratio (optimal around 2.0)
- Gross Margin percentage
**Calculation**: Weighted average of quality metrics with caps to prevent outlier distortion

### 3. Momentum Factor (25% Weight)
**Rationale**: Persistence of price trends across multiple timeframes
**Metrics**:
- 1-month price momentum
- 3-month price momentum
- 6-month price momentum
- 12-month momentum (excluding last month)
**Calculation**: Time-weighted momentum average, normalized to prevent extreme values

### 4. Size Factor (15% Weight)
**Rationale**: Small-cap premium documented in academic literature
**Metrics**:
- Market capitalization
**Calculation**: Logarithmic scaling to capture size premium, with smaller companies receiving higher scores

### 5. Low Volatility Factor (10% Weight)
**Rationale**: Low-volatility anomaly and risk-adjusted return optimization
**Metrics**:
- Annualized historical volatility (inverse)
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe-like ratio)
**Calculation**: Combined volatility and risk-adjusted return scoring with 60/40 weighting
