# Cash Flow Reliability Score Model

## Executive Summary
The Cash Flow Reliability Score Model is a sophisticated quantitative framework designed to evaluate the reliability and sustainability of corporate earnings through comprehensive cash flow analysis. This model assesses the relationship between Operating Cash Flow (OCF) and reported earnings to identify companies with high-quality, sustainable earnings backed by strong cash generation capabilities.

## Model Architecture

### Core Methodology
The model employs a multi-factor analysis framework that evaluates five critical components of cash flow reliability:

1. **OCF Conversion Ratio Analysis (25% weight)** - Measures efficiency of earnings-to-cash conversion
2. **Cash Flow Stability Assessment (20% weight)** - Evaluates consistency and predictability of cash flows
3. **Working Capital Management (20% weight)** - Analyzes efficiency of working capital utilization
4. **Accruals Quality Evaluation (15% weight)** - Assesses quality of earnings adjustments and accounting practices
5. **Free Cash Flow Generation (20% weight)** - Measures sustainable cash generation capability

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API with 3-year historical analysis
- **Statistical Methods**: Multi-component scoring with weighted aggregation
- **Risk Metrics**: Volatility analysis, maximum drawdown calculation
- **Financial Ratios**: OCF/Net Income, FCF Yield, FCF Conversion ratios
