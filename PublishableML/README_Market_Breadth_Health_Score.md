# Market Breadth Health Score Model

## Overview

The Market Breadth Health Score Model is a sophisticated quantitative system that evaluates market breadth and participation across multiple dimensions to assess overall market health. The model combines advance/decline metrics, new highs/lows analysis, sector participation, and momentum indicators to provide comprehensive breadth assessment for market timing and trend validation.

## Model Architecture

### Core Framework
The model employs a multi-component scoring system with weighted contributions:

1. **Advance/Decline Health (30% weight)** - Daily and cumulative A/D patterns
2. **New Highs/Lows Distribution (25% weight)** - Extreme performance analysis
3. **Sector Participation Breadth (20% weight)** - Cross-sector participation
4. **Volume-Weighted Breadth (15% weight)** - Volume-adjusted participation
5. **Momentum Breadth Quality (10% weight)** - Momentum distribution analysis

### Technical Implementation

#### Component 1: Advance/Decline Health (30%)
- **Daily A/D Ratios**: Current day advancing vs declining stocks
- **Volume-Weighted A/D**: Volume participation in advancing vs declining issues
- **Cumulative A/D Line**: Multi-timeframe cumulative advance/decline patterns (5, 20, 50 days)
- **Trend Analysis**: Short vs medium-term A/D momentum comparison
- **Participation Rate**: Overall market participation assessment

**Key Metrics:**
- Daily advance/decline ratio
- Volume-weighted advance/decline ratio
- 5-day, 20-day, and 50-day cumulative A/D trends
- Market participation rate (active vs total stocks)

#### Component 2: New Highs/Lows Distribution (25%)
- **Multi-Period Analysis**: 20-day, 50-day, and 252-day new highs/lows
- **Net Extremes**: New highs minus new lows across timeframes
- **Concentration Analysis**: Distribution quality assessment
- **52-Week Positioning**: Stocks near 52-week highs vs lows

**Key Metrics:**
- New highs/lows percentages across multiple timeframes
- Net new highs calculations

#### Component 4: Volume-Weighted Breadth (15%)
- **Volume-Weighted A/D**: Multi-period volume-adjusted advance/decline
- **Price-Momentum Weighting**: Volume-weighted price momentum analysis
- **On-Balance Volume Breadth**: OBV trend analysis across universe
- **Volume Surge Analysis**: Identification of volume expansion patterns

**Key Metrics:**
- Volume-weighted advance/decline ratios
- Price-momentum volume weighting
- OBV breadth percentage
- Volume surge participation rates

#### Component 5: Momentum Breadth Quality (10%)
- **Multi-Timeframe Momentum**: 5, 10, and 20-period momentum analysis
- **Momentum Distribution**: Quality assessment of momentum spread
- **RSI Breadth Analysis**: Cross-sectional RSI distribution
- **Momentum Consistency**: Coefficient of variation analysis

**Quality Metrics:**
- Momentum breadth percentages
- Distribution quality scores
- RSI zone analysis (overbought/oversold/neutral)
- Momentum consistency measurements

## Scoring Methodology

### Composite Score Calculation
```
Breadth Score = (AD_Health × 0.30) + (Highs_Lows × 0.25) + 
                (Sector_Participation × 0.20) + (Volume_Breadth × 0.15) + 
                (Momentum_Quality × 0.10)
```

### Rating Scale
- **Excellent Breadth (0.80-1.00)**: Strong bull market characteristics
- **Strong Breadth (0.70-0.79)**: Healthy advance with good participation  
- **Good Breadth (0.60-0.69)**: Moderate strength, selective opportunities
- **Neutral Breadth (0.50-0.59)**: Mixed signals, market in transition
- **Weak Breadth (0.40-0.49)**: Deteriorating conditions, caution advised
- **Poor Breadth (0.00-0.39)**: Stressed conditions, defensive positioning
