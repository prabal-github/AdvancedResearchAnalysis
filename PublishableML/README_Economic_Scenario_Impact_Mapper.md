## Technical Implementation

### Economic Scenario Framework

The system employs a 5-scenario probabilistic framework:

1. **Base Case (40% probability)**: Moderate growth with stable inflation
2. **Strong Growth (20% probability)**: High GDP growth with rising demand
3. **Economic Slowdown (25% probability)**: Below-trend growth with weak demand
4. **High Inflation (10% probability)**: Rising prices with monetary tightening
5. **Interest Rate Shock (5% probability)**: Sharp rate increases

### Macroeconomic Factors

Six critical macro factors with base values and scenario variations:

| Factor | Base Value | Strong Growth | Slowdown | High Inflation | Rate Shock |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| GDP Growth | 6.5% | 8.0% | 4.0% | 5.5% | 5.0% |
| Inflation Rate | 4.5% | 5.5% | 3.0% | 7.0% | 6.0% |
| Interest Rate | 6.5% | 7.0% | 5.5% | 8.0% | 9.5% |
| USD/INR | 83.0 | 82.0 | 85.0 | 84.0 | 86.0 |
| Oil Price | $85 | $90 | $75 | $95 | $80 |
| Global Growth | 3.2% | 4.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 2.8% |

### Sector Classification System

The model categorizes stocks into 17 distinct sectors with specific sensitivity matrices:
- **Cyclical Sectors**: Automotive, Metals, Mining, Infrastructure
- **Defensive Sectors**: FMCG, Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Utilities
- **Financial Services**: Banking, Insurance, Financial Services
- **Growth Sectors**: IT Services, Consumer Discretionary, Telecommunications
