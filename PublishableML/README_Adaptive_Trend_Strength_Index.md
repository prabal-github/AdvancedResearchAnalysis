# Adaptive Trend Strength Index Model

## Executive Summary

The Adaptive Trend Strength Index represents a sophisticated technical analysis framework designed to evaluate trend strength and direction across multiple timeframes using advanced slope analysis and momentum indicators. This model provides comprehensive trend assessment through adaptive algorithms that adjust to market conditions, volatility patterns, and volume dynamics, offering quantitative insights for trend-following and momentum-based investment strategies.

## Model Architecture

### Core Framework
The model employs a five-component analytical structure that captures different dimensions of trend strength and persistence:

1. **Short-Term Trend Strength (20% weight)** - Immediate trend momentum analysis
2. **Medium-Term Trend Strength (25% weight)** - Intermediate trend assessment  
3. **Long-Term Trend Strength (25% weight)** - Primary trend identification
4. **Momentum Consistency (15% weight)** - Cross-timeframe alignment analysis
5. **Volume Validation (15% weight)** - Volume-weighted trend confirmation

### Technical Implementation

#### Multi-Timeframe Slope Analysis
- **Very Short-Term**: 5 and 10-period adaptive slopes for immediate momentum
- **Short-Term**: 20-period slope with enhanced weighting
- **Medium-Term**: 50-period slope for intermediate trend assessment
- **Long-Term**: 200-period slope for primary trend identification

#### Adaptive Slope Calculation
The model utilizes sophisticated slope calculation techniques:
- Savitzky-Golay smoothing for noise reduction in adaptive mode
- Linear regression with R-squared weighting for reliability
- Price-normalized slopes for cross-stock comparability
- Sigmoid transformation for intuitive scoring (0-1 scale)

#### Volume-Based Validation
- On-Balance Volume (OBV) trend analysis
- Accumulation/Distribution Line momentum
- Volume-price correlation assessment
- Up/down volume distribution analysis
