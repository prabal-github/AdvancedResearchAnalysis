⚠️  CURRENT STATUS: 404 ERROR - Routes not yet registered!
✅ Your Flask app is running on port 5008
❌ Agentic AI routes need to be integrated into your app.py

🎯 INTEGRATION STEPS (CORRECTED):

1. Add imports to your app.py:
   ```python
   from agentic_routes import register_agentic_routes
   from agentic_models import InvestmentAgent, AgentRecommendation
   ```

2. Register routes after app creation:
   ```python  
   register_agentic_routes(app, db)
   ```

3. Create database tables:
   ```python
   with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()
   ```

4. Restart Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access dashboard:
   - Visit http://localhost:5000/agentic_ai
   - OR click "AI Assistant" button in admin/investor dashboards

🚀 QUICK START INTEGRATION:

Run the integration script:
```bash
python integrate_agentic_ai.py
```
This will automatically:
- Update your app.py with necessary imports
- Create database table SQL scripts
- Provide step-by-step instructions

🔧 MANUAL INTEGRATION (If script fails):

1. Add to app.py imports section:
```python
try:
    from agentic_routes import register_agentic_routes
    from agentic_models import InvestmentAgent, AgentRecommendation
    AGENTIC_AI_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    AGENTIC_AI_AVAILABLE = False
```

2. Add after db.create_all():
```python
if AGENTIC_AI_AVAILABLE:
    register_agentic_routes(app, db)
```
