## Environment Variables (Alternative)

You can still use environment variables as a fallback:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-api-your-key-here"

# Windows Command Prompt  
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api-your-key-here

# Linux/Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api-your-key-here"
```
