# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT - HARDCODED CREDENTIALS FOUND

## ‚ùå IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The security scan found **45 files** with hardcoded credentials. While most are migration and test scripts, several critical files need immediate attention:

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED:

### 1. **save_ml_models_to_rds.py** - CRITICAL
- Used by main application
- Contains: `RDS_URL = "postgresql://admin:admin%402001@3.85.19.80:5432/research"`

### 2. **simple_db_test.py** - MODERATE  
- Testing file but may be used in production
- Contains: `ML_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:admin%402001@3.85.19.80:5432/research"`

### 3. **create_admin_account.py** - HIGH
- Creates admin accounts with hardcoded password
- Contains: `admin_password = "Subir@54812"`

## ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED (SECURE):
- `ml_database_config.py` ‚úÖ
- `extract_all_114_ml_models.py` ‚úÖ  
- `docker-compose.yml` ‚úÖ
- Main `app.py` application ‚úÖ

## üìã IMMEDIATE TODO:
1. Fix the 3 critical files above
2. Secure any migration scripts that might run in production
3. Review and secure demo account passwords

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION READINESS:
**Current Status: NOT READY** - Critical files still contain hardcoded credentials
**Next Steps: Fix the 3 high-priority files immediately**

The main application (`ml_database_config.py`) is secure, but supporting scripts need fixes before production deployment.
