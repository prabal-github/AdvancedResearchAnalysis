# Single Stock Portfolio Implementation for Affordable Investing

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of single stock portfolios in the hAi-Edge system to make AI-powered investing more affordable for new investors with limited capital.

## Business Motivation
- **Accessibility**: Lower entry barrier for new investors
- **Affordability**: Reduce minimum investment requirements  
- **Simplicity**: Easier portfolio management for beginners
- **AI Benefits**: Still provide ML-driven stock selection with lower risk

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. Real-Time Stock Fetcher (`real_time_stock_fetcher.py`)
```python
# Updated default parameters to support 1 stock
def get_portfolio_prices(self, symbols=None, quantity=1):
    """Default changed from 10 to 1 stock for affordability"""

def create_balanced_portfolio(self, investment_amount=1000000, portfolio_name="Balanced", stock_quantity=1):
    """Default changed from 10 to 1 stock for affordability"""
```

#### B. Route Handler (`hai_edge_routes_bp.py`) 
```python
# Updated portfolio size validation and defaults
portfolio_size = request.args.get('size', 1, type=int)  # Default to 1 stock
if portfolio_size not in [1, 2, 5, 10]:
    portfolio_size = 1  # Default fallback to single stock
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### A. Portfolio Size Selection (`templates/hai_edge_model_detail.html`)
```html
<!-- Added 1 stock option as primary choice -->
<input type="radio" class="btn-check" name="portfolioSize" id="size1" value="1" 
       {% if request.args.get('size', 1)|int == 1 %}checked{% endif %}>
<label class="btn btn-outline-success" for="size1">
    <i class="fas fa-star me-1"></i>1 Stock (Most Affordable)
</label>
```

#### B. Updated Labels and Messaging
- Changed label to "Portfolio Size - Affordable Options"
- Added green highlight for 1-stock option
- Updated notification to emphasize affordability

#### C. Dashboard Banner (`templates/hai_edge_dashboard.html`)
```html
<!-- New affordability banner -->
<div class="alert alert-success border-0 shadow-sm">
    <h5 class="alert-heading mb-1">
        <i class="fas fa-star text-warning me-2"></i>
        Now Available: Single Stock Portfolios for Beginners!
    </h5>
    <p class="mb-0">
        Start your AI-powered investment journey with just 1 stock - 
        perfect for new investors with limited capital.
    </p>
</div>
```

### 3. User Experience Improvements

#### A. Visual Indicators
- **Green badge** for 1-stock option (vs. blue for others)
- **Star icon** to highlight the recommended affordable option
- **Success alert** styling to emphasize the benefit

#### B. Contextual Messaging
- "Most Affordable" badge in dashboard
- "Perfect for beginners with lower investment capital" tooltip
- Dynamic notification based on selected portfolio size

#### C. Default Behavior
- **Default portfolio size**: 1 stock (changed from 10)
- **URL parameter support**: `?size=1` (set as default)
- **Backward compatibility**: Still supports 2, 5, and 10 stock options

## Portfolio Size Options

| Option | Investment Level | Target Audience | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **1 Stock** | ₹5,000 - ₹50,000 | Beginners, Students | Moderate |
| 2 Stocks | ₹10,000 - ₹1,00,000 | New Investors | Balanced |
| 5 Stocks | ₹25,000 - ₹2,50,000 | Regular Investors | Diversified |
| 10 Stocks | ₹50,000+ | Experienced Investors | Well-Diversified |

## Benefits of Single Stock Portfolios

### For Investors
1. **Lower Entry Cost**: Start with as little as ₹5,000
2. **Simplified Management**: Track just one position
3. **AI Selection**: Still benefits from ML-driven stock selection
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Perfect for understanding market dynamics
5. **Scalability**: Can upgrade to multi-stock portfolios later

### For Platform
1. **Increased Accessibility**: Attract new user segments
2. **User Onboarding**: Easier entry point for beginners
3. **Retention**: Users can grow with the platform
4. **Market Expansion**: Tap into smaller investment amounts

## Technical Features

### Stock Selection Algorithm
- AI-powered selection of the **best performing stock** from top 20 Indian stocks
- Real-time price updates and market analysis
- Performance tracking and analytics for single positions

### Investment Allocation
```python
# For 1-stock portfolio
allocation_per_stock = investment_amount / 1  # 100% allocation
market_value = quantity * current_price
allocation_percent = 100.0  # Full portfolio allocation
```

### Risk Management
- **Concentrated Risk**: Users are informed about single-stock concentration
- **AI Mitigation**: Stock selection uses multiple ML models for validation
- **Educational Content**: Guidance on portfolio diversification as users grow
