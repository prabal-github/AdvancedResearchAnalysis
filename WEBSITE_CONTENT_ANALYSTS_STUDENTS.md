## VS Terminal Features (Analyst Command Surface)
The in‑platform "vs_terminal" (virtual strategy terminal) provides a low-latency command layer for power users.

| Capability | Command Pattern | Outcome | Primary Users |
|------------|-----------------|---------|---------------|
| Event Snapshot | `events:latest --limit 25` | Returns most recent normalized events/news | Analysts / Students |
| Prediction Window | `predict:events --days 15 --format table` | Tabular forward events w/ probability & impact | Analysts |
| Volatility Regime | `vol:regime` | Current VIX level + regime classification | Risk / Analysts |
| Model Recs | `models:recommend --context focus=inflation` | Filtered model suggestion list | Analysts / Students |
| Publish Model | `model:publish path=./notebooks/inflation_nowcast.ipynb` | Submits descriptor + artifact for review | Analysts / Quants |
| Backtest Kickoff | `backtest:start --model macro_inflation_nowcast --from 2023-01-01` | Asynchronous backtest job | Quants |
| Diagnostics | `diag:feed --show lag,failures` | Health & latency metrics for data feeds | Engineering / Lead Analyst |
| Skill Log | `skill:log --tag regime_analysis --evidence report_2025W35.md` | Adds evidence entry to analyst skill profile | Students / Analysts |
| Research Export | `export:research --id EV1234 --format pdf` | Generates research packet for specific event | All |
| Help | `help:<command>` | Inline usage & examples | Everyone |

Power Features:
- Tab completion & semantic aliasing (e.g., `pred:ev` → `predict:events`).
- JSON / TABLE / CSV format switches for downstream scripting.
- Inline diffing: `model:compare --a macro_inflation_nowcast --b policy_rate_impact`.
- Rate-limit aware batching to avoid external API throttling.

Student Accelerator Tips:
- Start each session with `events:latest` then `predict:events` to build an immediate mental model.
- Use `skill:log` after completing each mini-analysis to accumulate a demonstrable learning trail.

## ML Model Publishing Opportunity
We encourage analysts and advanced students to contribute production-grade or experimental models.

Publishing Workflow:
1. Draft: Prepare notebook / script with clear `fit`, `predict`, and metadata cell.
2. Descriptor: Fill required fields (name, category, expected_alpha_range, features, validation_metric, rationale).
3. Validation: Run `backtest:start` or local evaluation; capture metrics (Sharpe, IR, max drawdown, hit rate).
4. Submission: `model:publish` command packages descriptor + artifact hash.
5. Automated Checks: Lint (naming, dependency safety), schema validation, reproducibility smoke test.
6. Human Review: Quant + Risk sign-off (focus on overfitting checks & data leakage review).
7. Registry Entry: Appears in Published Models catalog with status (experimental / validated / deprecated).

Acceptance Criteria (Baseline):
- Min lookback coverage: ≥ 2 distinct volatility regimes.
- Out-of-sample performance: Sharpe ≥ 0.8 or defined contextual benchmark uplift ≥ 10%.
- Drawdown control: Max DD within risk band for category.
- Transparent feature list & no PII / restricted data usage.

Incentives:
- Leaderboard points (model quality + adoption).
- Certification badge (Validated Model Contributor).
- Featured spotlight in monthly platform digest.

Student Path Variant:
- "Incubator" label until full regime coverage achieved.
- Mentor feedback loop on feature selection & validation methodology.

Planned Extensions:
- Auto-calibration alerts when performance decay detected.
- Continuous evaluation dashboard with rolling metrics & drift signals.

## Performance Analysis & Skill Learning (Research Report Driven)
The platform links research output quality to skill growth metrics.

Research Report Lifecycle:
1. Scoping: Analyst selects target event or predicted catalyst.
2. Data Collection: Pull live feed snapshot + historical analog events.
3. Hypothesis Framing: Define expected market response pathways.
4. Analytical Execution: Factor decomposition, regime overlay, scenario stress grid.
5. Model Alignment: Select or propose model(s) covering identified edges.
6. Recommendation & Risk: Position sizing logic with hedge suggestions.
7. Post-Event Attribution: Compare realized vs forecast; log variances.

Automatic Metrics Captured:
- Forecast Accuracy (directional & magnitude buckets).
- Timing Precision (lead/lag vs event timestamp).
- Volatility Anticipation Score (predicted vs realized regime correctness).
- Model Selection Efficacy (chosen model relative performance rank).
- Risk Discipline (sizing within prescribed volatility-adjusted bands).

Skill Profile Dimensions:
| Dimension | Signals | Sample Improvement Tip |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Regime Analysis | Vol regime hit rate, timing precision | Compare multi-window volatility indicators |
| Event Forecasting | Directional accuracy, confidence calibration | Maintain reliability diagram journal |
| Model Selection | Strategy pick performance uplift | Implement pre-trade checklist weighting factors |
| Risk Framing | Sizing adherence, drawdown containment | Use scenario matrices before commitment |
| Research Communication | Clarity & completeness audits | Use structured executive summary template |

Feedback Loop:
- After each report closure, system assigns micro-learning recommendations (articles, internal docs, sample notebooks) aligned to weakest dimension.
- `skill:log` command ties artifacts to objective evidence.

Student Progression Bands:
| Band | Criteria | Unlocks |
|------|---------|---------|
| Explorer | ≥ 3 reports with baseline completeness | Access to incubator model submission |
| Practitioner | ≥ 8 reports & regime hit rate >60% | Elevated publish quota |
| Advanced | ≥ 15 reports & calibration error <10% | Direct fast-track to validation review |

Planned Skill Features:
- Calibration dashboard (Brier score trend + reliability curves).
- Adaptive learning playlists auto-refreshed monthly.
- Mentor matching suggestions based on complementary strengths.

Usage Tips:
- Treat each research report as a controlled experiment; isolate hypotheses.
- Maintain a variance ledger: why actual diverged from expected.
- Revisit decayed model assumptions quarterly.

## FAQs
Q: Are predictions guaranteed?  
A: No—they are heuristic unless full calibrated engine active; use as directional signal.  
Q: Can students access the same data feed?  
A: Yes; real-time plus optional sandbox snapshots for reproducibility.  
Q: What skills will I build?  
A: Event interpretation, regime analysis, feature ideation, model selection rationale, risk framing.  
Q: How do I know if advanced ML is active?  
A: The analyzer mode badge shows FULL; otherwise a stub fallback is in use.
