**After:** Query "Latest on INFY.NS" → Correctly identifies only "INFY.NS" ✅

### Comprehensive Test Suite Results
```
🧪 Testing Enhanced Ticker Extraction: ✅ PASS
🌐 Testing API Endpoint: ✅ PASS  
📊 Testing Knowledge Base Stats: ✅ PASS
📊 Test Results: 3/3 tests passed 🎉

## 🛠 Technical Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Ticker Extraction Logic
**File:** `app.py` → `enhanced_ai_query_analysis()` function
```python
# Fixed regex pattern
ticker_pattern = r'\b([A-Z]{2,10}\.(?:NS|BO))\b'

# Fixed filtering logic (CRITICAL FIX)
# Before: tickers = [t for t in tickers if not any(word in t.upper().replace('.NS', '') for word in common_words)]
# After: tickers = [t for t in tickers if t.upper().replace('.NS', '').replace('.BO', '') not in common_words]
```

#### 2. Real-time Market Data Function
**File:** `app.py` → `ClaudeClient.get_real_ticker_data()` method
- Yahoo Finance API integration
- Error handling for invalid tickers
- Market data formatting and validation

#### 3. Knowledge Base Stats Enhancement
**File:** `app.py` → `get_enhanced_knowledge_stats()` function
- Added real-time .NS stock data fetching
- Market summary calculations
- Live stock price monitoring

#### 4. API Endpoints Added
```python
@app.route('/ai_query_analysis', methods=['POST'])  # For testing
@app.route('/api/enhanced_knowledge_stats')        # For live stats
```

#### 5. Frontend Enhancements
**File:** `templates/enhanced_ai_research_assistant.html`
- Added live stock data section
- CSS styling for stock visualization
- Real-time data refresh capability
