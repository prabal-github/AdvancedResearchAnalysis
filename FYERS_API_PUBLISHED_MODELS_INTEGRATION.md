# Fyers API Integration for Published Models - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Overview

Successfully integrated Fyers API with YFinance fallback for all ML models in the published catalog (http://127.0.0.1:5008/published), ensuring real-time data access and RDS database compatibility.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Model Execution API
- **Modified `/api/published_models/<mid>/run`**: Enhanced with real-time data integration
- **New `/api/published_models/<mid>/run_realtime`**: Dedicated real-time execution endpoint
- **Real-time Data Injection**: Automatic real-time data fetching for model execution
- **Dual Data Sources**: Fyers API (primary) + YFinance (fallback)

### ‚úÖ Published Catalog Enhancements
- **Real-time Model Detection**: Visual indicators for models that support real-time data
- **Enhanced Run Dialog**: Integrated Fyers API controls with symbol input and testing
- **Real-time Results Display**: Formatted output showing live market data
- **Data Source Transparency**: Clear indication of whether Fyers or YFinance was used

### ‚úÖ Database Integration (RDS Compatible)
- **Enhanced Run History**: Stores real-time execution metadata
- **MLModelResult Creation**: Automatic creation of dashboard-compatible results
- **Data Source Tracking**: Records which API (Fyers/YFinance) was used
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time and confidence scoring

### ‚úÖ Advanced Features
- **Auto-Detection**: Identifies real-time capable models based on keywords
- **Model Type Classification**: Automatically routes to appropriate ML model (Stock/BTST/Options/Sector)
- **Symbol Validation**: Test real-time data connection before model execution
- **Usage Limits**: Higher limits for real-time models (15 runs/day vs 10)

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Modified Files

1. **app.py**
   - Enhanced `run_published_model()` function with real-time data injection
   - Added new `run_published_model_realtime()` endpoint
   - Integrated RealTimeDataFetcher and ML models
   - Added real-time metadata to response payloads

2. **templates/published_catalog.html**
   - Enhanced run dialog with Fyers API controls
   - Added real-time status indicators and testing
   - Modified executeRun() function for dual execution modes
   - Added visual indicators for real-time capable models

3. **Database Schema**
   - Leverages existing AdminAPIKey model for Fyers credentials
   - Uses PublishedModelRunHistory for execution tracking
   - Creates MLModelResult entries for dashboard integration

### Real-time Model Detection Logic

Models are automatically detected as real-time capable if they contain keywords:
- **Financial**: stock, market, equity, nifty, sensex
- **Trading**: btst, option, sector, trade, investment  
- **Analysis**: technical, fundamental, volatility, momentum
- **Data**: price, return, cash flow, analysis

### API Endpoints Added

```
POST /api/published_models/<mid>/run_realtime
{
  "function": "run_analysis",
  "symbol": "RELIANCE.NS", 
  "use_fyers": true,
  "category": "large_cap"
}

Response:
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {...},
  "model_type": "stock_recommender",
  "symbol": "RELIANCE.NS",
  "execution_time": 2.34,
  "realtime_enabled": true,
  "run_id": "realtime_model123_..."
}
```

### Enhanced Standard API

The existing `/api/published_models/<mid>/run` endpoint now supports:
```json
{
  "function": "run_analysis",
  "use_realtime": true,
  "symbol": "TCS.NS",
  "inputs": {},
  "timeout": 600
}
```
