# Fixed Quantity Strategy Implementation

## Overview
The hAi-Edge system now implements a **Fixed Quantity Strategy** where each portfolio uses specific, predetermined quantities of stocks rather than calculated quantities based on investment amounts. This provides more predictable and strategic positioning.

## Fixed Quantity Strategy Design

### Portfolio Quantity Allocation

| Portfolio Size | Quantity per Stock | Total Holdings | Strategy Focus |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1 Stock** | 10 shares | 10 shares total | Concentrated exposure |
| **2 Stocks** | 5 shares each | 10 shares total | Balanced risk |
| **5 Stocks** | 1 share each | 5 shares total | Diversified |
| **10 Stocks** | 1 share each | 10 shares total | Maximum diversification |

### Strategic Rationale

#### 1 Stock × 10 Shares
- **Concentrated Position**: Higher exposure to best AI-selected stock
- **Moderate Risk**: Balanced between concentration and excessive risk
- **Cost Efficient**: Single stock monitoring and management
- **Example**: RELIANCE.NS × 10 shares

#### 2 Stocks × 5 Shares Each
- **Balanced Approach**: Splits risk between two top selections
- **Equal Weight**: 5 shares each for balanced exposure
- **Sector Diversification**: Typically different sectors
- **Example**: RELIANCE.NS × 5, TCS.NS × 5

#### 5 Stocks × 1 Share Each
- **Diversified Sampling**: Exposure to 5 different opportunities
- **Lower Individual Risk**: 1 share limits single-stock impact
- **Sector Spread**: Multiple sectors represented
- **Example**: 5 different blue-chip stocks × 1 share each

#### 10 Stocks × 1 Share Each
- **Maximum Diversification**: Broad market exposure
- **Risk Minimization**: Single share limits downside
- **Learning Portfolio**: Good for understanding market dynamics
- **Example**: Top 10 AI-selected stocks × 1 share each

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`real_time_stock_fetcher.py`)

```python
# Fixed quantity allocation logic
if stock_quantity == 1:
    fixed_quantities = [10]  # Single stock gets 10 shares
elif stock_quantity == 2:
    fixed_quantities = [5, 5]  # Each stock gets 5 shares
elif stock_quantity == 5:
    fixed_quantities = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # Each stock gets 1 share
else:  # stock_quantity == 10
    fixed_quantities = [1] * 10  # Each stock gets 1 share

for i, stock_data in enumerate(portfolio_data['portfolio_stocks']):
    quantity = fixed_quantities[i] if i < len(fixed_quantities) else 1
    market_value = quantity * stock_data['current_price']
```

### Frontend Updates

#### Portfolio Selection Interface
```html
<!-- Updated labels to show exact quantities -->
<label class="btn btn-outline-success" for="size1">
    <i class="fas fa-star me-1"></i>1 Stock × 10 Shares
</label>

<label class="btn btn-outline-primary" for="size2">
    <i class="fas fa-chart-pie me-1"></i>2 Stocks × 5 Shares Each
</label>

<label class="btn btn-outline-primary" for="size5">
    <i class="fas fa-chart-bar me-1"></i>5 Stocks × 1 Share Each
</label>

<label class="btn btn-outline-primary" for="size10">
    <i class="fas fa-chart-line me-1"></i>10 Stocks × 1 Share Each
</label>
```

#### Updated Messaging
- **Dashboard Banner**: "Fixed Quantity Strategy: Smart Stock Holdings!"
- **Strategy Description**: Clear explanation of quantity allocation
- **Notification**: Shows exact quantities for selected portfolio

## Benefits of Fixed Quantity Strategy

### For Investors
1. **Predictable Quantities**: Always know exactly how many shares you hold
2. **Strategic Positioning**: Quantities designed for optimal risk-return
3. **Easy Tracking**: Round numbers make portfolio monitoring simple
4. **Cost Transparency**: Easy to calculate exact investment amounts
5. **Scalable Growth**: Can buy additional fixed-quantity sets

### For Portfolio Management
1. **Consistent Strategy**: All portfolios follow same quantity logic
2. **Risk Control**: Predetermined quantities limit over-concentration
3. **Rebalancing Simplified**: Easy to add/remove fixed quantity blocks
4. **Performance Analysis**: Standardized quantities enable better comparison
5. **Educational Value**: Clear structure helps users understand positioning

## Investment Examples

### Real-World Scenarios

#### 1 Stock Portfolio (10 shares)
```
Stock: RELIANCE.NS
Quantity: 10 shares
Price: ₹2,500 per share
Investment: ₹25,000
Strategy: Concentrated exposure to top AI pick
```

#### 2 Stock Portfolio (5 shares each)
```
Stock 1: RELIANCE.NS × 5 shares = ₹12,500
Stock 2: TCS.NS × 5 shares = ₹18,500
Total Investment: ₹31,000
Strategy: Balanced exposure across sectors
```

#### 5 Stock Portfolio (1 share each)
```
RELIANCE.NS × 1 = ₹2,500
TCS.NS × 1 = ₹3,700
INFY.NS × 1 = ₹1,800
HDFCBANK.NS × 1 = ₹1,650
ICICIBANK.NS × 1 = ₹1,200
Total Investment: ₹10,850
Strategy: Diversified sampling
```

#### 10 Stock Portfolio (1 share each)
```
10 different stocks × 1 share each
Estimated Total: ₹15,000 - ₹25,000
Strategy: Maximum diversification
```
