- **Sector Impact (10%)**: Breadth of market impact

### Stock Selection Algorithm

1. **Sector Mapping**: Identify affected market sectors
2. **Stock Pool Analysis**: Select from curated stock pools by sector
3. **Impact Scoring**: Calculate individual stock correlation to event
4. **Weight Distribution**: Optimize portfolio weights based on impact scores
5. **Risk Balancing**: Ensure appropriate diversification and risk levels

### Performance Metrics

- **Total Return**: Portfolio return vs initial value
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns
- **Alpha**: Excess return vs benchmark
