# Send File Import Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The Flask application was throwing the error:

```
ERROR:app:Error generating certificate: name 'send_file' is not defined
```

## Root Cause

The `send_file` function from Flask was not imported in the application imports at the top of `app.py`.

## Solution Applied

Added `send_file` to the Flask imports:

**Before:**

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, render_template, session, Response, redirect, url_for, flash
```

**After:**

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, render_template, session, Response, redirect, url_for, flash, send_file
```

## Functions Using send_file

The following functions in the application use `send_file` and were affected:

1. **Certificate Generation Routes:**

   - `/certificate/<request_id>/generate` - View certificate in browser
   - `/certificate/<request_id>/download` - Download certificate file
   - `/admin/certificates/download/<request_id>` - Admin download certificate

2. **Performance Analysis Routes:**

   - `/analyst/performance_analysis/<request_id>/download` - Download performance PDF

3. **Other File Download Routes:**
   - Various report download functions
   - Documentation and file serving endpoints

## Status

âœ… **Fixed** - The `send_file` import has been added and the Flask application has been restarted with the updated imports.

## Testing

The application is now running at http://127.0.0.1:80 and the certificate generation/download functionality should work without the import error.

## Next Steps

- Test certificate generation by submitting a certificate request
- Verify that both viewing (generate) and downloading certificates work
- Test the new performance analysis PDF download functionality
