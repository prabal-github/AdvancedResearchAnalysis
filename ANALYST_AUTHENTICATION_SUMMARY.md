## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Database Integration
- Uses existing SQLAlchemy models and database structure
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- Proper foreign key relationships with Report and ResearchTopicRequest models

### Authentication Flow
1. Admin creates analyst account via `/admin/create_analyst`
2. Analyst logs in via `/analyst_login` with username/password
3. Session management tracks analyst authentication
4. Protected routes use `@analyst_required` decorator
5. Logout clears session via `/analyst_logout`

### Research Workflow
1. Analyst views available tasks in `/analyst/research_tasks`
2. Takes tasks using `/analyst/take_task/<task_id>`
3. Submits reports via `/analyst/submit_report`
4. Tracks progress in `/analyst/my_reports`
5. Develops skills through `/analyst/skill_development`

### Security Features
- Password hashing with secure salt
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- CSRF protection via Flask forms
- Input validation and sanitization
