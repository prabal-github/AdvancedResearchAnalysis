Great idea—yes, it’s possible. You can build it two ways: a fast-to-market hosted API route, or an in-house open-source pipeline. Here’s how to approach it in your Flask app.

Checklist

Generate a clean spoken script from the report (summary).
Convert script to natural voice (TTS).
Animate an avatar from a front-face image lip-synced to the audio.
Add brand overlays/captions; export video (MP4).
Run it as a background job; show progress and deliverable in the dashboard.
Ensure consent, watermarking, and plan-based usage controls.
Option A: Hosted “avatar video” APIs (simplest, production-ready)

Services: D-ID, HeyGen, Synthesia, Colossyan.
Flow:
Summary script: Use your existing summarizer to produce ~120–180 words (60–90s).
TTS: Either the provider’s built-in voices or your own (e.g., Azure TTS/ElevenLabs) and upload audio.
Avatar video: Send the uploaded face image + audio or script to the provider’s API.
Poll for job completion; store the returned MP4 URL; display in dashboard.
Pros: Best quality/fidelity, no GPU required, least maintenance.
Cons: Cost per minute, vendor lock-in, data governance considerations.
Option B: Open-source pipeline (fully in-house)

Components:
Summarization: Your existing report summarizer (already in the app).
TTS: Azure Cognitive Services / Amazon Polly / Google TTS / ElevenLabs (best naturalness).
Lip-sync avatar: Wav2Lip (classic lip-sync) or SadTalker (more realistic head motion).
Video assembly: ffmpeg/MoviePy to add lower-third, logo/watermark, captions.
Flow:
Analyst uploads a frontal image (good lighting, straight face).
Generate a short, speaker-friendly script from the report.
Generate TTS: Save as WAV/MP3 with a target sample rate (e.g., 16 kHz/22.05 kHz).
Lip-sync:
Wav2Lip: image + audio -> talking head (512x512). Fast and simple.
SadTalker: better head motion; more compute and setup.
Compose: Add title card, lower-third (Analyst name/role), subtle background, brand watermark.
Export MP4; store path; show in dashboard.
Infra:
GPU strongly recommended (CUDA) for Wav2Lip/SadTalker. CPU will be slow.
Windows compatible with proper PyTorch/CUDA setup and ffmpeg.
Pros: Full control, no per-minute fees.
Cons: Setup/maintenance, GPU requirement, quality tuning.
How to wire it into your Flask app

Data model:
AvatarVideoJob(id, analyst_id, report_id, status, script_text, audio_path, video_path, duration, error, created_at).
Endpoints:
POST /analyst/avatar_video (image upload + report_id) → returns job_id.
GET /api/avatar_video/<job_id>/status → progress/state.
GET /analyst/videos → list of generated videos with thumbnails.
Worker:
Use Celery or RQ to run the pipeline asynchronously (summarize → TTS → lip-sync → compose → save).
UI:
On report page: “Generate AI Avatar Summary” button.
Show status chip (Queued/Processing/Ready); show preview player in modal when done.
Add usage plan gating and a soft-limit notice (you already have soft-limit logic).
Quality and UX tips

Script: Keep sentences short; add pauses; target 120–140 words per minute.
Voices: Offer 2–3 voices; support Hindi/English if needed.
Safety: Show consent checkbox; watermark “AI-generated”; log who generated what and when.
Performance: Cache the report’s summary; avoid regenerating if text unchanged.
Cost control: Mark this as a Pro/Pro+ feature; include length caps (e.g., max 90s).
Recommended stacks

Hosted: D-ID or HeyGen (both have Python/REST SDKs).
Open-source: Wav2Lip + Azure/ElevenLabs TTS + MoviePy + ffmpeg; GPU with PyTorch.
Next steps (quick)

Decide API vs OSS based on budget and infra.
I can scaffold the Job model, routes, and a background worker, plus a simple UI button and status ribbon.
