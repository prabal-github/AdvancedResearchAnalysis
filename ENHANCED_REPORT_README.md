    """Enhanced institutional-grade report generation"""
    
    # Create enhanced generator
    generator = EnhancedReportGenerator()
    
    # Extract ticker symbols if any
    tickers = _extract_ticker_symbols(subject, requirements)
    
    if tickers:
        # Generate professional report with market data
        report = generator.generate_institutional_report(
            ticker=tickers[0],
            analysis_type='comprehensive',
            custom_requirements=requirements,
            ai_model=ai_model
        )
    else:
        # Use enhanced analysis for non-stock reports
        report = _generate_enhanced_analysis(subject, requirements, urls, pdf_files, ai_model)
    
    return report
```
