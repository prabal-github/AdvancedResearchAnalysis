## ✅ DATABASE LOCK & ANALYST PERMISSION FIXES - COMPLETE

### 🎯 **OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED**

1. **✅ Fixed Database Lock Error**: "Analysis completed but no report ID returned"
2. **✅ Implemented Analyst Permissions**: "analyst can only edit his own account. analyst can check performance of other analyst"

---

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

#### **1. Database Lock Handling**
- **Problem**: SQLite database locks causing "Analysis completed but no report ID returned"
- **Solution**: Progressive retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Implementation**:
  - Added retry logic in `analyze_report` function (lines ~5285-5300)
  - Progressive delays: 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s between retries
  - Graceful 503 responses with retry flag for busy database
  - Fallback UUID generation for conflict resolution

#### **2. API Metrics Resilience**
- **Problem**: `/api/metrics` endpoint failing under database load
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling with graceful degradation
- **Implementation**:
  - Max 3 retries with progressive delays
  - Fallback error responses when database unavailable
  - User-friendly "temporarily unavailable" messages

#### **3. Analyst Permission System**
- **Problem**: Analysts could edit any profile, no access restrictions
- **Solution**: Role-based access control with session validation
- **Implementation**:
  - Profile editing restricted to own account only
  - Performance viewing allowed for all analysts (read-only)
  - Session-based permission checking
  - Automatic redirect to login for unauthorized access
