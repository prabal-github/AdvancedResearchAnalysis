# AI-Powered Compliant Report Generator

## Overview
The AI-Powered Compliant Report Generator is an innovative feature that extends the Enhanced Analysis system to generate improved, SEBI-compliant versions of analyst reports using Claude AI. This system shows analysts "how their report should look with full compliance" based on the Enhanced Analysis feedback.

## Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Generation
- Uses Claude Sonnet 3.5/4 for sophisticated report analysis and improvement
- Fallback template system when AI is not available
- Real-time generation based on Enhanced Analysis feedback

### üìã SEBI Compliance Enhancement
- Addresses specific SEBI compliance issues identified in Enhanced Analysis
- Includes proper risk disclosure sections
- Adds regulatory disclaimers and conflict of interest statements
- Improves transparency in methodology and assumptions

### üìä Professional Structure
- Executive Summary with clear investment thesis
- Comprehensive Company/Sector Overview
- Detailed Financial Analysis with key metrics
- Risk Assessment with multiple risk categories
- Valuation Analysis with clear methodology
- Investment Recommendation with evidence-based conclusions
- Regulatory Disclosures and disclaimers

### üîÑ Side-by-Side Comparison
- Original report vs. AI-improved version
- Tabbed interface for easy navigation
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Download compliant report as text file

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. `generate_compliant_report(report, enhanced_analysis)` Function
```python
def generate_compliant_report(report, enhanced_analysis):
    """Generate AI-powered compliant version of analyst report"""
```
- Located in `app.py` after Claude client initialization
- Takes report object and enhanced analysis results
- Returns formatted compliant report using Claude API
- Includes fallback template for non-API environments

#### 2. `/generate_compliant_report/<int:report_id>` Route
```python
@app.route('/generate_compliant_report/<int:report_id>')
def generate_compliant_report_route(report_id):
```
- REST API endpoint for generating compliant reports
- Returns JSON response with generated content
- Includes error handling and validation
- Requires Enhanced Analysis to be completed first

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Enhanced Analysis UI Integration
- New "AI-Powered Compliant Report Generation" section added to `enhanced_analysis.html`
- Located after Report Overview section
- Includes loading states and error handling

#### 2. Interactive Features
- **Generate Button**: Triggers AI report generation
- **Tabbed Interface**: Switch between compliant version and side-by-side comparison
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy generated report text
- **Download Report**: Save as text file
- **Real-time Formatting**: Markdown to HTML conversion

#### 3. JavaScript Functionality
```javascript
// AI Compliant Report Generation functionality
generateCompliantBtn.addEventListener('click', async function() {
    // Handles API calls, UI states, and error handling
});
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Upload Report**: Analyst uploads research report
2. **Run Enhanced Analysis**: System analyzes report for quality, compliance, and risks
3. **Generate Compliant Version**: Click "Generate Compliant Version" button
4. **Review Improvements**: View AI-generated compliant report
5. **Compare Versions**: Use side-by-side comparison to see differences
6. **Download/Copy**: Save or copy the improved report

## API Configuration

### Claude API Setup
```bash
# Set environment variable for Claude API
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Fallback Mode
When Claude API is not available, the system uses a template-based approach that still provides valuable compliance guidance and structure improvements.

## Enhanced Analysis Integration

The compliant report generator leverages all Enhanced Analysis components:

- **SEBI Compliance Score**: Addresses specific compliance issues
- **Risk Disclosure Score**: Enhances risk assessment sections
- **Geopolitical Assessment**: Includes geopolitical risk factors
- **Quality Scores**: Improves overall report quality
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Incorporates all suggested improvements

5. **Compliance Tracking**: Track compliance improvements over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Set**: Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
2. **Enhanced Analysis Required**: Run Enhanced Analysis before generating compliant report
3. **Generation Timeout**: Check network connection and API status
4. **Template Fallback**: Normal behavior when API is unavailable

### Error Messages

- `Enhanced analysis must be completed before generating compliant report`
- `Server error: [detailed error message]`
- `Failed to generate compliant report`
