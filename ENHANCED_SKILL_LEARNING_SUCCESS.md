## 💡 **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE**

### **Analyst Writes:**

> _"TCS reported impressive revenue growth of 16.8% year-over-year, reaching ₹59,381 crores in Q3 FY2024"_

### **System Shows:**

```
📝 What You Wrote in Your Report:
💭 "TCS reported impressive revenue growth of 16.8% year-over-year, reaching ₹59,381 crores in Q3 FY2024"

⬇️ Now see how to implement this analysis using code ⬇️

🐍 Financial Trend Analysis - Code Implementation
```

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Revenue trend analysis based on your report data
data = {
    'Quarter': ['Q3 2023', 'Q3 2024'],
    'Revenue': [50976, 59381],  # in crores (from your analysis)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['Revenue_Growth'] = df['Revenue'].pct_change() * 100

# Your 16.8% growth rate calculation
growth_rate = ((59381 - 50976) / 50976) * 100
print(f"YoY Growth Rate: {growth_rate:.1f}%")  # Matches your 16.8%
```

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Backend Enhancement:**

```python
def extract_relevant_content(report_text, keywords):
    """Extract relevant sentences from report text based on keywords"""
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]+', report_text)
    relevant_sentences = []

    for sentence in sentences:
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if len(sentence) > 20:  # Avoid very short sentences
            for keyword in keywords:
                if keyword.lower() in sentence.lower():
                    relevant_sentences.append(sentence)
                    break

    return relevant_sentences[:3]  # Return top 3 relevant sentences
```

### **Enhanced Data Structure:**

```python
python_analysis = {
    'title': 'Financial Trend Analysis',
    'skill_category': 'python',
    'original_content': extract_relevant_content(report_text, financial_keywords),
    'code_example': '...',  # Generated code
    'explanation': '...',   # How code works
    'business_insight': '...'  # Why it matters
}
```

### **Frontend Enhancement:**

```html
<!-- Original Analyst Content Section -->
{% if module.original_content and module.original_content|length > 0 %}
<div class="alert alert-info border-start border-4 border-info">
  <h6 class="alert-heading">
    <i class="bi bi-person-check me-2"></i>What You Wrote in Your Report
  </h6>
  <p class="text-muted small mb-2">
    Here's the original content from your analysis that inspired this code
    example:
  </p>
  {% for content in module.original_content %}
  <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded border-start border-4 border-secondary mb-2">
    <i class="bi bi-quote text-muted me-2"></i>
    <em>"{{ content }}"</em>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
  <div class="mt-2">
    <small class="text-primary">
      <i class="bi bi-arrow-down me-1"></i>
      <strong>Now see how to implement this analysis using code ↓</strong>
