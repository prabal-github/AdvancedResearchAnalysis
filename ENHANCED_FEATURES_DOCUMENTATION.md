# Enhanced Research Quality Assessment System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive enhancements made to the research quality assessment system, adding advanced features for geopolitical risk assessment, SEBI compliance checking, global standards validation, and multi-report comparison capabilities.

## New Features Added

### 1. Geopolitical Risk Assessment (`_assess_geopolitical_risks`)
**Purpose**: Evaluate geopolitical risks mentioned in research reports based on SEBI regulations and global standards.

- **SEBI Risk Disclosure Compliance**: Checks for 6 mandatory risk categories (market, liquidity, credit, operational, regulatory, concentration)
- **Risk Level Classification**: Categorizes risk as Low/Medium/High based on mentions
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides actionable recommendations for enhancing risk coverage

**Scoring Impact**: Contributes 10% to the composite quality score

### 2. SEBI Compliance Assessment (`_check_sebi_compliance`)
**Purpose**: Ensure research reports comply with SEBI Research Analyst Regulations 2014.

**Key Components**:
- **6 Compliance Categories**: 
  - Analyst Credentials
  - Disclosures & Conflicts of Interest
  - Risk Warnings
  - Price Target Methodology
  - Research Methodology
  - Disclaimers
- **Mandatory Disclosures Check**: Validates 5 critical SEBI requirements
- **Compliance Rating**: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor classification
- **Issue Identification**: Highlights missing compliance elements

**Scoring Impact**: Contributes 8% to the composite quality score

### 3. Global Standards Compliance (`_check_global_standards`)
**Purpose**: Assess adherence to international research standards and best practices.

**Key Components**:
- **6 Global Standards Categories**:
  - CFA Standards
  - IOSCO Principles
  - ESG Coverage
  - International Accounting Standards
  - Fair Disclosure
  - Research Independence
- **ESG Integration**: Evaluates environmental, social, governance coverage
- **International Perspective**: Assesses global market awareness
- **Global Rating**: World-class/International/Regional/Local classification

### 4. Document Comparison System (`compare_reports`)
**Purpose**: Enable side-by-side analysis of multiple reports on the same stock.

**Key Components**:
- **Quality Metrics Comparison**: Compares all scoring dimensions across reports
- **Consensus Analysis**: Calculates average scores, standard deviations, and ranges
- **Divergence Detection**: Identifies significant disagreements between analysts
- **Bias Analysis**: Evaluates sentiment consensus and disagreement levels
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Suggests actions based on comparison results

## Enhanced Scoring Algorithm

### Updated Composite Score Calculation
```
Composite Score = 
  20% × Factual Accuracy +
  15% × Predictive Power +
  12% × (1 - |Bias Score|) +
  12% × Originality +
  15% × Risk Disclosure +
  8%  × Transparency +
  10% × Geopolitical Assessment +
  8%  × SEBI Compliance
```

### New Assessment Categories
1. **Geopolitical Risk Score**: 0.0-1.0 (Higher = Better risk coverage)
2. **SEBI Compliance Score**: 0.0-1.0 (Higher = Better compliance)
3. **Global Standards Score**: 0.0-1.0 (Higher = Better global alignment)

## New Routes and Templates

### Backend Routes
1. **`/compare_reports`** (GET/POST): Multi-report comparison interface
2. **`/api/reports_by_ticker/<ticker>`**: Fetch reports for specific ticker
3. **`/enhanced_analysis/<report_id>`**: Advanced analysis view with new assessments

### Frontend Templates
1. **`compare_reports.html`**: Interactive comparison interface with charts
2. **`enhanced_analysis.html`**: Comprehensive analysis dashboard
3. **Updated `layout.html`**: Added navigation for new features
4. **Updated `report.html`**: Enhanced Analysis button integration
