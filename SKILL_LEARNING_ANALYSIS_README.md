);
```

### Core Function
```python
def generate_skill_learning_analysis(report_text, tickers, analysis_result):
    """Generate skill learning breakdowns showing how to implement financial analysis using code"""
    skill_analyses = []
    
    # 1. Financial Data Analysis (Python)
    if any(word in report_text.lower() for word in ['revenue', 'growth', 'sales']):
        # Generate pandas/matplotlib examples
    
    # 2. Technical Analysis (Python)  
    if tickers:
        # Generate yfinance/TA examples
    
    # 3. Database Analysis (SQL)
    if any(word in report_text.lower() for word in ['financial', 'quarterly']):
