### Certificate Generation Levels
| Certificate | Requirements | Auto / Manual | Renewal Logic |
|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Report Completion Certificate | 5 approved research reports | Auto | N/A |
| Analytical Progress Certificate | 10 reports + calibration error <15% | Auto | Review annually |
| Model Contributor Certificate | 1 draft + backtest metrics meeting baseline | Manual (Quant Review) | Retest if stale > 6 months |
| Validated Model Certificate | 1 validated model + governance sign-off | Manual (Risk + Quant) | Performance drift triggers revalidation |
| Learning Path Certificate | Finish core tutorial + quizzes | Auto | Optional refresher |
| Advanced Forecasting Certificate | 15 reports + Brier improvement trend | Auto | Revoke if metrics decay 2 consecutive quarters |

### Skill Progress Calculation (Illustrative)
- Each action logs weighted points by dimension (e.g., Regime annotation: Regime Analysis +2, Risk Discipline +1).
- Weekly normalization prevents farming a single low-effort action.
- Progress bars per dimension unlock badges at thresholds (Bronze, Silver, Gold).

### Student Focused Path
1. Complete Learning Path → foundational certificate.
2. Submit first 3 reports → explorer band.
3. Achieve calibration improvement → forecasting badge.
4. Publish incubator model idea → model track initiation.
5. Earn Analytical Progress Certificate → ready for mentorship pairing.

### Analyst Professional Track
1. Establish daily catalyst streak.
2. Maintain prediction calibration (rolling error threshold).
3. Validate at least one model (or steward an existing one).
4. Contribute peer reviews monthly.
5. Hold updated certificates (no expired validations).

### Transparency & Governance
- Certificates embed issue date, criteria hash, and verification ID.
- QR / hash lookup endpoint (planned) for external validation.
- Revocation events recorded for audit trail (e.g., model drift > threshold).

### Why It Matters
- Converts invisible analytical labor into a verifiable track record.
- Encourages balanced skill development (not only headline scanning).
- Provides students with portfolio-grade evidence; gives teams governance clarity.

CTA Block Suggestion: "See Your Next Unlock" (opens personalized progression modal).

## Implementation Notes (For Web Team – Remove in Production)
- Use semantic <section> blocks with aria-labels per major theme.
- Lazy-load heavy charts post first contentful paint.
- Add JSON-LD schema for SoftwareApplication + EducationalOrganization (dual value positioning).
- Optimize hero for LCP; inline critical CSS for typography & layout shell.
